**Bad Code:**
```javascript
function sum() {return a + b}
```

**Issues:**
* **Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are not declared as parameters or local variables within the
function's scope. This will lead to a `ReferenceError` when the function is called, as `a` and `b` are undefined.
* **Lack of Parameters:** A `sum` function should explicitly take the numbers to be summed as parameters, making it
reusable, predictable, and independent of external state. Relying on global or implicitly defined variables is a common
source of bugs and makes code harder to debug and maintain.
* **Poor Readability & Maintainability:** Without parameters, it's unclear what values `a` and `b` are supposed to
represent or where they are coming from. This makes the code difficult to understand at a glance and harder to modify or
extend.
* **No Input Validation:** There is no check to ensure that the values being added are actually numbers. If `a` or `b`
were strings, it would result in string concatenation (e.g., "1" + "2" = "12"), which is likely not the intended
behavior for a `sum` function.

**Recommended Fix**

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* This function takes two numerical arguments and returns their sum.
*
* @param {number} num1 - The first number.
* @param {number} num2 - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2. Returns NaN if inputs are not numbers.
*/
function sum(num1, num2) {
// Input validation: Ensure both arguments are numbers
if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {
console.error("Error: sum() expects two numbers as arguments, but received non-number type(s).");
// Depending on strictness, you might throw an error instead of returning NaN:
// throw new TypeError("Arguments to sum() must be numbers.");
return NaN; // Return NaN (Not a Number) to indicate an invalid numerical result
}
return num1 + num2;
}

// Example Usage:
// console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8
// console.log(sum(10, -4)); // Output: 6
// console.log(sum("a", 7)); // Output: Error message and NaN
// console.log(sum(null, 5)); // Output: Error message and NaN
```

**Improvements:**
* **Explicit Parameters:** The function now clearly defines `num1` and `num2` as its expected inputs, enhancing clarity
and reusability.
* **Input Validation:** Added a `typeof` check to ensure that both arguments are numbers. This prevents unexpected
behavior (like string concatenation) and provides a clear error message in the console if invalid types are passed.
Returning `NaN` is a common pattern for numerical functions that receive non-numerical input.
* **Self-Contained:** The function is now self-contained and operates solely on its inputs, making it more robust,
easier to test, and independent of global state.
* **Improved Readability & Maintainability:** The function signature instantly communicates its purpose and required
inputs. The added JSDoc comments further enhance understanding, especially for future developers working with this code.
* **Error Handling:** While not throwing an error, it logs a helpful message and returns a predictable `NaN` value,
allowing the caller to handle invalid inputs gracefully. For stricter applications, throwing a `TypeError` might be
preferred.
